# This job needs to handle the 'pull_request' event to get the merge commit from the PR into the main branch of WildFly
# in the GITHUB_SHA environment variable. This is also stored in github.event.pull_request.head.sha.
# To do the remote dispatch, we need a secret containing the PAT that has the permissions to do invoke workflows in the
# remote repository. Since 'pull_request' jobs don't have access to secrets, we delegate to the
# 'cloud-test-pr-workflow-run.yml' workflow to do the remote dispatch.
